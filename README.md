# pyNCmap

Use NCL colortable in python matplotlib colormap without install package

All colortable in NCL exist in cmap_data.tar.gz (Ref: https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Graphics/color_table_gallery.shtml)

Unzip the compressed file and put the directory with python code

No compatibility issue

You can use reversed colormap to type "_r" after the colortable name (i.e., rainbow_r)
